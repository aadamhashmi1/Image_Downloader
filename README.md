# Image Grid with Quote Overlay

This React application allows users to search for images, generate random quotes, and overlay the quote text onto the images. The text on the image can be customized, and users can interact with the text directly on the image. When an image is clicked, it opens in a new tab, where the text overlay becomes interactive with control handles.

## Features

- **Search Images**: Users can search for images using a keyword.
- **Random Quote Generation**: Generate a random quote and search for related images.
- **Text Overlay**: The generated quote is overlaid on the selected image.
- **Text Customization**: Users can adjust the position, color, and font size of the text.
- **Interactive Text Handle**: When the text is clicked, a handle appears to help adjust its position. The handle disappears after one second when the cursor is not on the text.
- **Download Image**: The image with the overlayed text can be downloaded.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 10.8.1 or later)
